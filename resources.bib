  abstract   = {We analyze the convergence of randomized trace estimators. Starting at 1989, several algorithms have been proposed for estimating the trace of a matrix by 1/MΣi=1M ziT Azi, where the zi are random vectors; different estimators use different distributions for the zis, all of which lead to E(1/MΣi=1M ziT Azi) = trace(A). These algorithms are useful in applications in which there is no explicit representation of A but rather an efficient method compute zTAz given z. Existing results only analyze the variance of the different estimators. In contrast, we analyze the number of samples M required to guarantee that with probability at least 1-δ, the relative error in the estimate is at most ϵ. We argue that such bounds are much more useful in applications than the variance. We found that these bounds rank the estimators differently than the variance; this suggests that minimum-variance estimators may not be the best.We also make two additional contributions to this area. The first is a specialized bound for projection matrices, whose trace (rank) needs to be computed in electronic structure calculations. The second is a new estimator that uses less randomness than all the existing estimators.},

This chapter discusses the nature of the λ-transition in liquid helium. The purpose of the chapter is to discuss the specific heat experiment in detail and to show that the nature of the singularity is determined with very little ambiguity. The chapter describes the sonic general thermodynamic relations that are useful for systems possessing transitions of any type, including λ-transitions. The chapter also describes the relations to compare other properties that have been measured near the transition with the specific heat results. These include the expansion coefficient and the velocity of sound. The chapter also discusses the nature of cooperative transitions and suggests a method of distinguishing the long-range ordering effects from other contributions to the thermodynamic properties. The chapter also examines the apparently exceptional case of the superconducting transition.},

The expansion in ϵ = 4−d is explained [d is the dimension of space (statistical mechanics) or space-time (quantum field theory)]. The emphasis is on principles, not particular applications. Sections 1–8 provide a self-contained introduction at a fairly elementary level to the statistical mechanical theory. No background is required except for some prior experience with diagrams. In particular, a diagrammatic approximation to an exact renormalization group equation is presented in sections 4 and 5; sections 6–8 include the approximate renormalization group recursion formula and the Feyman graph method for calculating exponents. Sections 10–13 go deeper into renormalization group theory (section 9 presents a calculation of anomalous dimensions). The equivalence of quantum field theory and classical statistical mechanics near the critical point is established in section 10; sections 11–13 concern problems common to both subjects. Specific field theoretic references assume some background in quantum field theory. An exact renormalization group equation is presented in section 11; sections 12 and 13 concern fundamental topological questions.},

The well-known Londons theory yielded much, and is widley employed under certain conditions even nowadays, but is absolutely insufficient and has to be generalized. This problem was solved in the Ψ-theory of superconductivity by V. L. Ginzburg and L. D. Landau. Together they developed a phenomenological theory of superconductivity in the late 1940s. This theory proposes that those electrons that contribute to superconduction form a superfluid. The superconductor is described by a complex function Ψ called the order parameter, and |Ψ|2 indicates the fraction of electrons that has condensed into a superfluid. In his Nobel lecture V. L. Ginzburg also gives a ‘list’ of top problems in contemporary physics. Acquaintance with all subjects included in this ‘list’ is what he calls the ‘physical minimum’.},

As a concrete example let us consider a CSTR. This is an open system and as such subject to external constraints, namely the concentrations of the chemical species in the feed streams, the flow rate, the stirring rate, the temperature, and the incident light intensity in the case of a photochemical reaction. These external constraints characterize the state of the environment of the open system and will, in general, fluctuate more or less strongly. Such environmental fluctuations are particularly important for natural systems; here random fluctuations are always present and their amplitude is not necessarily small as in laboratory systems. In the latter systems the experimenter will of course try to minimize the effect of random perturbations, though it is impossible to eliminate noise completely. Clearly, random external noise is ubiquitous in open systems, but this fact by itself would hardly warrant a systematic study of the effects of external fluctuations. The question is whether noise is more than a mere nuisance we have to live with. Is there any hope of finding interesting physics? The intuitive, and wrong, answer would be negative: The system averages out rapid fluctuations and the only trace of external noise would be a certain fuzziness in the state of the system. Of course, if the state of the system becomes unstable, the fluctuations initiate the departure from the unstable state. Then the dynamics of the system take over and the system evolves to a new stable state.},

  abstract = {{I will briefly review the field of noise‐induced phase transitions, emphasizing the main differences with the phase‐induced transitions and showing that they appear in different systems. I will show that a noise‐induced transition can disappear after a suitable change of variables and I will also discuss the breaking of ergodicity and symmetry breaking that occur in noise‐induced phase transitions in the thermodynamic limit, but not in noise‐induced transitions.}},

We thus present a no-go theorem for putting theories of the weak interaction on a lattice. One of the most important consequences of our no-go theorem is that is not possible, in strong interaction models, to solve the notorious species doubling problem of Dirac fermions on a lattice in a chirally invariant way.},

The correct asymptotic freedom behaviour is recovered with the appropriate number of species taken into account. The models differ in their number of soft modes and their strong coupling behaviour. In some of them, chiral symmetry is restored at a finite coupling. The large-N, finite-temperature transition is also found in good agreement with the theoretical value.},
