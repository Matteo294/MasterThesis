  abstract   = {We analyze the convergence of randomized trace estimators. Starting at 1989, several algorithms have been proposed for estimating the trace of a matrix by 1/MΣi=1M ziT Azi, where the zi are random vectors; different estimators use different distributions for the zis, all of which lead to E(1/MΣi=1M ziT Azi) = trace(A). These algorithms are useful in applications in which there is no explicit representation of A but rather an efficient method compute zTAz given z. Existing results only analyze the variance of the different estimators. In contrast, we analyze the number of samples M required to guarantee that with probability at least 1-δ, the relative error in the estimate is at most ϵ. We argue that such bounds are much more useful in applications than the variance. We found that these bounds rank the estimators differently than the variance; this suggests that minimum-variance estimators may not be the best.We also make two additional contributions to this area. The first is a specialized bound for projection matrices, whose trace (rank) needs to be computed in electronic structure calculations. The second is a new estimator that uses less randomness than all the existing estimators.},

This chapter discusses the nature of the λ-transition in liquid helium. The purpose of the chapter is to discuss the specific heat experiment in detail and to show that the nature of the singularity is determined with very little ambiguity. The chapter describes the sonic general thermodynamic relations that are useful for systems possessing transitions of any type, including λ-transitions. The chapter also describes the relations to compare other properties that have been measured near the transition with the specific heat results. These include the expansion coefficient and the velocity of sound. The chapter also discusses the nature of cooperative transitions and suggests a method of distinguishing the long-range ordering effects from other contributions to the thermodynamic properties. The chapter also examines the apparently exceptional case of the superconducting transition.},

The expansion in ϵ = 4−d is explained [d is the dimension of space (statistical mechanics) or space-time (quantum field theory)]. The emphasis is on principles, not particular applications. Sections 1–8 provide a self-contained introduction at a fairly elementary level to the statistical mechanical theory. No background is required except for some prior experience with diagrams. In particular, a diagrammatic approximation to an exact renormalization group equation is presented in sections 4 and 5; sections 6–8 include the approximate renormalization group recursion formula and the Feyman graph method for calculating exponents. Sections 10–13 go deeper into renormalization group theory (section 9 presents a calculation of anomalous dimensions). The equivalence of quantum field theory and classical statistical mechanics near the critical point is established in section 10; sections 11–13 concern problems common to both subjects. Specific field theoretic references assume some background in quantum field theory. An exact renormalization group equation is presented in section 11; sections 12 and 13 concern fundamental topological questions.},

The well-known Londons theory yielded much, and is widley employed under certain conditions even nowadays, but is absolutely insufficient and has to be generalized. This problem was solved in the Ψ-theory of superconductivity by V. L. Ginzburg and L. D. Landau. Together they developed a phenomenological theory of superconductivity in the late 1940s. This theory proposes that those electrons that contribute to superconduction form a superfluid. The superconductor is described by a complex function Ψ called the order parameter, and |Ψ|2 indicates the fraction of electrons that has condensed into a superfluid. In his Nobel lecture V. L. Ginzburg also gives a ‘list’ of top problems in contemporary physics. Acquaintance with all subjects included in this ‘list’ is what he calls the ‘physical minimum’.},

  abstract  = {In this paper I will deal with the effect of external random perturbations, ``noise'', on chemical systems and other open nonlinear systems. As a concrete example let us consider a CSTR. This is an open system and as such subject to external constraints, namely the concentrations of the chemical species in the feed streams, the flow rate, the stirring rate, the temperature, and the incident light intensity in the case of a photochemical reaction. These external constraints characterize the state of the environment of the open system and will, in general, fluctuate more or less strongly. Such environmental fluctuations are particularly important for natural systems; here random fluctuations are always present and their amplitude is not necessarily small as in laboratory systems. In the latter systems the experimenter will of course try to minimize the effect of random perturbations, though it is impossible to eliminate noise completely. Clearly, random external noise is ubiquitous in open systems, but this fact by itself would hardly warrant a systematic study of the effects of external fluctuations. The question is whether noise is more than a mere nuisance we have to live with. Is there any hope of finding interesting physics? The intuitive, and wrong, answer would be negative: The system averages out rapid fluctuations and the only trace of external noise would be a certain fuzziness in the state of the system. Of course, if the state of the system becomes unstable, the fluctuations initiate the departure from the unstable state. Then the dynamics of the system take over and the system evolves to a new stable state.},

  abstract = {We present results for pseudo-critical temperatures of QCD chiral crossovers at zero and non-zero values of baryon (B), strangeness (S), electric charge (Q), and isospin (I) chemical potentials μX=B,Q,S,I. The results were obtained using lattice QCD calculations carried out with two degenerate up and down dynamical quarks and a dynamical strange quark, with quark masses corresponding to physical values of pion and kaon masses in the continuum limit. By parameterizing pseudo-critical temperatures as Tc(μX)=Tc(0)[1−κ2X(μX/Tc(0))2−κ4X(μX/Tc(0))4], we determined κ2X and κ4X from Taylor expansions of chiral observables in μX. We obtained a precise result for Tc(0)=(156.5±1.5) MeV. For analogous thermal conditions at the chemical freeze-out of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, i.e., μS(T,μB) and μQ(T,μB) fixed from strangeness-neutrality and isospin-imbalance, we found κ2B=0.012(4) and κ4B=0.000(4). For μB≲300 MeV, the chemical freeze-out takes place in the vicinity of the QCD phase boundary, which coincides with the lines of constant energy density of 0.42(6)GeV/fm3 and constant entropy density of 3.7(5)fm−3.},

In the absence of a genuine solution to the sign problem of lattice QCD, simulations at zero and imaginary baryon chemical potential in a parameter space enlarged by a variable number of quark flavours and quark masses constitute a viable way to constrain the location of a possible non-analytic phase transition and its critical endpoint. In this article I review recent progress towards an understanding of the nature of the transition in the massless limit, and its critical temperature at zero density. Combined with increasingly detailed studies of the physical crossover region, current data bound a possible critical point to μB ≳ 3T.},

  abstract = {An earlier suggestion that the chiral phase transition in QCD for two flavors of massless quarks might be a second-order transition has gained credibility as a result of recent numerical simulations. One can test this hypothesis, and draw very specific quantitative consequences from it, using universality and renormalization group ideas. This hypothetical second order phase transition is in the universality class of a four component isotropic Heisenberg antiferromagnet—a model which has been investigated intensely by condensed matter physicists. Existing calculations can be adapted to yield predictions for critical exponents governing the QCD transition. The perturbation due to small equal quark masses maps onto an external staggered magnetic field; that due to unequal quark masses is effective only in second order and generates a quadratic anisotropy. Several other potential applications of the renormalization group to related questions are suggested, including a model of the tricritical point which arises with finite strange quark mass, and a model for the dynamic critical behavior.},

First we determine the effect of imaginary values of the chemical potential on the transition temperature using lattice QCD simulations. Then we use various formulas to perform an analytic continuation to real values of the baryo-chemical potential. Our data set maintains strangeness neutrality to match the conditions of heavy ion physics. The systematic errors are under control up to μB≈300 MeV. For the curvature of the transition line we find that there is an approximate agreement between values from three different observables: the chiral susceptibility, chiral condensate and strange quark susceptibility. The continuum extrapolation is based on Nt=10, 12 and 16 lattices. By combining the analysis for these three observables we find, for the curvature, the value κ=0.0149±0.0021.},

  abstract = {We show that a Wilson-type discretization of the Gross–Neveu model, a fermionic N-flavor quantum field theory displaying asymptotic freedom and chiral symmetry breaking, can serve as a playground to explore correlated symmetry-protected phases of matter using techniques borrowed from high-energy physics. A large-N study, both in the Hamiltonian and Euclidean formalisms, yields a phase diagram with trivial, topological, and symmetry-broken phases separated by critical lines that meet at a tri-critical point. We benchmark these predictions using tools from condensed matter and quantum information science, which show that the large-N method captures the essence of the phase diagram even at N=1. Moreover, we describe a cold-atom scheme for the quantum simulation of this lattice model, which would allow to explore the single-flavor phase diagram.},
