  abstract   = {We analyze the convergence of randomized trace estimators. Starting at 1989, several algorithms have been proposed for estimating the trace of a matrix by 1/MΣi=1M ziT Azi, where the zi are random vectors; different estimators use different distributions for the zis, all of which lead to E(1/MΣi=1M ziT Azi) = trace(A). These algorithms are useful in applications in which there is no explicit representation of A but rather an efficient method compute zTAz given z. Existing results only analyze the variance of the different estimators. In contrast, we analyze the number of samples M required to guarantee that with probability at least 1-δ, the relative error in the estimate is at most ϵ. We argue that such bounds are much more useful in applications than the variance. We found that these bounds rank the estimators differently than the variance; this suggests that minimum-variance estimators may not be the best.We also make two additional contributions to this area. The first is a specialized bound for projection matrices, whose trace (rank) needs to be computed in electronic structure calculations. The second is a new estimator that uses less randomness than all the existing estimators.},

This chapter discusses the nature of the λ-transition in liquid helium. The purpose of the chapter is to discuss the specific heat experiment in detail and to show that the nature of the singularity is determined with very little ambiguity. The chapter describes the sonic general thermodynamic relations that are useful for systems possessing transitions of any type, including λ-transitions. The chapter also describes the relations to compare other properties that have been measured near the transition with the specific heat results. These include the expansion coefficient and the velocity of sound. The chapter also discusses the nature of cooperative transitions and suggests a method of distinguishing the long-range ordering effects from other contributions to the thermodynamic properties. The chapter also examines the apparently exceptional case of the superconducting transition.},

  abstract = {The modern formulation of the renormalization group is explained for both critical phenomena in classical statistical mechanics and quantum field theory. The expansion in ϵ = 4−d is explained [d is the dimension of space (statistical mechanics) or space-time (quantum field theory)]. The emphasis is on principles, not particular applications. Sections 1–8 provide a self-contained introduction at a fairly elementary level to the statistical mechanical theory. No background is required except for some prior experience with diagrams. In particular, a diagrammatic approximation to an exact renormalization group equation is presented in sections 4 and 5; sections 6–8 include the approximate renormalization group recursion formula and the Feyman graph method for calculating exponents. Sections 10–13 go deeper into renormalization group theory (section 9 presents a calculation of anomalous dimensions). The equivalence of quantum field theory and classical statistical mechanics near the critical point is established in section 10; sections 11–13 concern problems common to both subjects. Specific field theoretic references assume some background in quantum field theory. An exact renormalization group equation is presented in section 11; sections 12 and 13 concern fundamental topological questions.},
